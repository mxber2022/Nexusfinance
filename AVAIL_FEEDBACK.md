# Avail Nexus SDK Developer Feedback

## üéØ Our Experience Building NexusFinance

Hey Avail team! üëã 

We just finished building NexusFinance - a comprehensive cross-chain DeFi platform using your Nexus SDK. Overall, we're really impressed with what you've built! The SDK is powerful and the documentation is much better than we initially thought.

**Rating: 9/10** - The Nexus SDK is powerful and well-designed. We had a great experience building with it, though there are a few areas where it could be even better.

## ‚úÖ What We Loved

### 1. **Core Functionality**
The `bridgeAndExecute` function is a game-changer! We were able to implement cross-chain deposits to perpetual DEXes in a single transaction. The `getUnifiedBalances()` API is also really well thought out - being able to see balances across all chains in one call saved us a lot of complexity.

### 2. **Developer Experience**
The TypeScript integration is top-notch. We never had to guess what parameters a function needed, and the React hooks (`useNexus`) made integration super smooth. The error messages are actually helpful (which is rare!), and the SDK initialization is straightforward.

## üí° How You Could Make It Even Better

### 1. **Oops! We Missed This Feature** üòÖ

When we were building our FlowFi page, we ended up writing manual aggregation because we didn't realize `getUnifiedBalance(symbol)` already existed! 

```typescript
// We did this unnecessarily...
const allBalances = await sdk.getUnifiedBalances();
const aggregatedBalances: Record<string, number> = {};

allBalances.forEach((asset) => {
  const { symbol, balance } = asset;
  if (!aggregatedBalances[symbol]) {
    aggregatedBalances[symbol] = 0;
  }
  aggregatedBalances[symbol] += parseFloat(balance);
});

// When we could have just done this! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
const usdcBalance = await sdk.getUnifiedBalance('USDC');
```

**Lesson learned:** The SDK already has what we needed - we just didn't find it in the docs! Maybe it could be more prominent in the examples?

### 2. **Documentation is Actually Great!**

We initially thought the docs were missing stuff, but after diving deeper into the [API Reference](https://docs.availproject.org/nexus/avail-nexus-sdk/nexus-core/api-reference), we found everything we needed. The examples are solid and the error handling docs are really helpful.

### 3. **What We'd Love to See Next**

#### **Perpetual DEX Integration**
We built a lot of custom integration with Hyperliquid, Aster, and Reya. It would be amazing if the SDK had built-in support for opening positions on these DEXes. Right now we're doing a lot of manual work to:
- Fetch funding rates
- Get market data
- Open/close positions
- Track PnL

Having SDK methods like `sdk.openPosition({ dex: 'hyperliquid', asset: 'BTC', side: 'long', leverage: 10 })` would be incredible!

#### **Market Data Helpers**
We're manually fetching funding rates and market data from different DEXes. Having unified market data methods would be super helpful:
```typescript
const fundingRates = await sdk.getFundingRates(['BTC', 'ETH']);
const bestRates = await sdk.getBestFundingRates('BTC'); // Across all DEXes
```

#### **Token Extensibility & Future Support** ü™ô
While the SDK currently supports USDC, USDT, and ETH well, we'd love to see more comprehensive token support for the future:

- **Custom token support** - Ability to add new tokens without SDK updates
- **Token metadata API** - Get token symbols, decimals, and addresses dynamically
- **Multi-token operations** - Bridge multiple tokens in a single transaction


#### **Avoiding Multiple Signatures** üéØ
One UX improvement we'd love to see is better handling of multiple signature requirements. When users bridge and execute, they sometimes need to sign multiple transactions (approval + execution). It would be amazing if the SDK could:

- **Batch approvals** when possible
- **Use permit signatures** for gasless approvals (like we implemented for Hyperliquid)
- **Provide clear progress indicators** showing "Step 1 of 3: Approving USDC..."
- **Auto-detect when permits are available** and use them instead of traditional approvals

This would make the user experience much smoother, especially for DeFi operations that require multiple steps. Right now users might get confused when they see multiple signature prompts.

## üèÜ Bottom Line

The Nexus SDK is really solid! We were able to build a comprehensive cross-chain DeFi platform without too much friction. The `bridgeAndExecute` function is particularly impressive - it saved us tons of complexity.

**What we'd love to see:**
1. **Perpetual DEX integration** - Built-in support for Hyperliquid, Aster, etc.
2. **Unified market data** - One API for funding rates across all DEXes
3. **Better multi-signature UX** - Fewer signature prompts, clearer progress
4. **Token extensibility** - Support for more tokens (DAI, WBTC, etc.) and dynamic token discovery

But honestly, even without these, the SDK is already really powerful. We're definitely going to use it for future projects!

**Final Rating: 10/10** - Great SDK with room to become even better! üöÄ
